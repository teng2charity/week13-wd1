            <h2>Quote</h2>   
        <p>"In a badly designed book, the letters mill and stand like starving horses
            in a field. In a book designed by rote, they sit like stale bread and
             mutton on the page. In a well-made book, where designer, compositor
            and printer have all done their jobs, no matter how many thousands of
            lines and pages, the letters are alive. They dance in their seats.
            Sometimes they rise and dance in the margins and aisles."</p>
